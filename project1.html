                Project 1: CNG Leakage Alert System

            <h2> Project Overview</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CNG gas is composed of 80 to 90% methane. It is odourless gas in its natural state hence ethyl mercaptan is 
                added as odorant before distribution of gas. But anosmic people (people with no sense of smell) or people with 
                little sense of smell may not respond immediately to CNG leak so they may not be able to take any immediate 
                action. This CNG leakage can cause explosion which will not only affect that vehicles but also the nearby area. In 
                such a situation, a system that will detect CNG gas leakage and prevent people from accidents is required.
                So considering this problem we have developed a demo system which is a low budget model which will detect 
                CNG gas leakage and send the appropriate message to the mobile.</p>
